Hi! Thanks for stopping by.

### Bio

Currently, I'm a student at Vanderbilt with ambitions of pursuing postgraduate work and study in economics. I have worked as an undergraduate research assistant at Vanderbilt's Research on Conflict and Collective Action (ROCCA) Lab.

I hope to focus on the mechanisms of social status, racialization, connectedness, and geography within economies â€” especially where opportunities exist to work with historical data.

In my free time, I like to write for campus publications, play geography and word games, and chip away at my latest library loan.

### Skills

-   Programming: R, Python

    I can perform data cleaning, advanced manipulation of data frames, and implement statistical models.

-   Writing

    Though I have ample experience with technical and academic writing, my background in journalism allows me to tailor my voice for general audiences as well.

-   Mathematics

    My coursework has covered the basic calculus sequence, plus differential equations and linear algebra. I am in the process of completing a math minor, so more classes are to come!

-   Economics and Econometrics
  
    I have taken econometrics, intermediate micro and macro, and an independent study course. My independent study focused on comparing the approach of different authors to measuring economic resilience, culminating in a metaregression of resilience on different shocks. 
  
    I am pursuing the honors track for my economics major and plan to write a thesis.
  

-   Effortless Charm

      Self explanatory. {{< iconify twemoji:winking-face >}}
