    "text": "Hi! Thanks for stopping by.\n\nBio\nCurrently, I’m a student at Vanderbilt with ambitions of pursuing postgraduate work and study in economics. I have worked as an undergraduate research assistant at Vanderbilt’s Research on Conflict and Collective Action (ROCCA) Lab.\nI hope to focus on the mechanisms of social status, racialization, connectedness, and geography within economies — especially where opportunities exist to work with historical data.\nIn my free time, I like to write for campus publications, play geography and word games, and chip away at my latest library loan.\n\n\nSkills\n\nProgramming: R, Python\nI can perform data cleaning, advanced manipulation of data frames, and implement statistical models.\nWriting\nThough I have ample experience with technical and academic writing, my background in journalism allows me to tailor my voice for general audiences as well.\nMathematics\nMy coursework has covered the basic calculus sequence, plus differential equations and linear algebra. I am in the process of completing a math minor, so more classes are to come!\nEconomics and Econometrics\nI have taken econometrics, intermediate micro and macro, and an independent study course. My independent study focused on comparing the approach of different authors to measuring economic resilience, culminating in a metaregression of resilience on different shocks.\nI am pursuing the honors track for my economics major and plan to write a thesis.\nEffortless Charm\nSelf explanatory. \n\n\n\nReach out!\nWant to hire me, collaborate with me, or chastise me?
