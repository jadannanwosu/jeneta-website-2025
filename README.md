# j. adanna nwosu, again
*An overhauled version of my personal website using Quarto*


When I first made a GitHub pages site, I didn't know how GitHub worked and also I had no idea that I could make one simply using R, a language I already knew.
This version is an attempt to make my own truly customized website.
