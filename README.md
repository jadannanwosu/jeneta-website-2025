*An overhauled version of my personal website using Quarto*


When I first made a GitHub pages site, I didn't know how GitHub worked and I had no idea that I could make one simply with an language I already knew.
I got a template with a theme I liked and called it a day.
This version is an attempt to make my own truly customized website.
