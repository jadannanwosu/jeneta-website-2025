0,1,Every Little Thing,"
You said to me, “Another?”
How you been keeping, brother?
Way back in '99 I led you on the road of doubt
'Cause I got your number

You can't even see
Oh yeah, I got you pegged
Oh, I begged and begged
To get you through the door
It wakes me up inside just to feel your pain
And keep you listening
You're so broke

Every little thing about you I fixate in the shadows
Been seeming like you're gonna be getting down to me
Ever since you put on a pair of those blue jeans
Every little thing about you I fixate in the guttеr
You're perfect in a couplе of different ways, buddy
And I ain't growing tired of letting you love me

Who said you need another?
I'll be your keeper, brother
You'd never know but I
Won't let your body go without
'Cause I got your number

You and me just seem
Like we've got it made
Got your hand in spade
So let go

Every little thing about you I fixate in the shadows
Been seeming like you're gonna be getting down to me
Ever since you put on a pair of those blue jeans
Every little thing about you I fixate in the gutter
You're perfect in a couple of different ways, buddy
And I ain't growing tired of letting you love me"
1,2,Yasmina,"
Yasmina, grab me there beside ya
Don't ever wanna say you're anything but mine-a
I've found loving you to be so very easy
And though I know, you may go
I'll be damned not to try and be
Yasmina, keep me in your head
Don't have anybody else a-living there instead
Won't you let me be most of your time 
You could spend your days over at mine
If you can't, it's fine
I'll be dying
What is it that you've done to me?

When you're gone, I can't let you go
When you want me, I'll sеt you so
Let me know that I'm yours today
I won't have it no othеr way

Yasmina, grab me there beside ya
I don't ever wanna say you're anything but mine-a
Found loving you to be so very easy
And though I know, you may go
I'll be damned not to try and be

When you're gone, I can't let you go
When you want me, I'll set you so
Let me know that I'm yours today
I won't have it no other way


Yasmina, grab me there beside ya
Don't ever wanna say you're anything but mine-a"
2,3,Am I Your Girl,"
Am I your girl
Once again now
Could be your all
But you figured me out in the bathroom stall
I was, you've been
But could be you're back at me
Am I your girl
Am I yours

You've been up my way here before
Leaning your ear up to my door
Months have brought me somebody new
Yeah it's not you

Am I your girl
Once again now
Could be your all
But it seems I lost you a bit last fall
I was, you've been
But could be you're back at me
Am I your girl
Am I yours

You've been up my way here before
Leaning your ear up to my door
Months have brought me somebody new
Yeah it's not you"
3,4,Little Dive,"
Down the street
There's a little dive
When the clock hits six like flies to shit
Fridays hit is a couple off the Jäger Bombs
For 20 you could blow
Should we go
Down the street
There's a little guy
With a bag for you and I to split
10 each hit
If he's got enough you let me know
For 20 you could blow 
Should we go

Heaven for a moment you could own a little piece of candy
You could take it from the top
And let it rock
Or just crash it away
Maybe for a moment you could notice how you feel just dandy
You could take it from the top
And let it rock
Or just crash it away

Down the street
It's a little live
And the band it's in
Thеy might be shit
They're all lit
If you wanna comе you let me know
For 20 at the door
Should we go

Heaven for a moment you could own a little piece of candy
You could take it from the top
And let it rock
Or just crash it away
Maybe for a moment you could notice how you feel just dandy
You could take it from the top
And let it rock
Or just crash it away


Heaven for a moment you could own a little piece of candy
You could take it from the top
And let it rock
Or just crash it away
Maybe for a moment you could own a little piece of candy
You could take it from the top
And let it rock
Or just crash it away
Heaven for a moment you could notice how you feel just dandy
You could take it from the top
And let it rock
Or just crash it away"
4,5,Outta Here,"
The further away from you I get, the better
Of these sudden times
I'm coming across like I've never been better
And it tastes so fine
You ruled over me like I'm fooling around
When I'm not one to fool
So now I'm outta your way to get everything
Just like you seemed to believe I wanted to
I'm outta here baby, I just wanted you

Who'd you want back seconds down Ontarie hill?
Who'd so long been said to wait upon you still?
With your ripe old reasons I'm not one to blame
It's feeling all thе same
Pull me from the drain

Last night you camе to me up in a dream
Broke into my room
You said that you knew I'd been spying on you
And began to scream
Worst is the way that you played me for so long
Hell, was it all just a dream?
Now that you've left and you're on your own
Am I just some pictures deep in your iPhone?
Do I cry alone?

Who'd you want back seconds down Ontarie hill?
Who'd so long been said to wait upon you still?
With your ripe old reasons I'm not one to blame
It's feeling all the same
Pull me from the drain


Who'd you want back seconds down Ontarie hill?
Who'd so long been said to wait upon you still?
With your ripe old reasons I'm not one to blame
It's feeling all the same
Pull me from the drain"
5,6,Did You Love Somebody,"In your voice so soft and low
Did you wake your loves that've come before?
Did you bring all those songs you sing?
Or have I been sung only songs for me?
Did you love somebody only just for the rush like me?
Did you fear the hand you hold had let go?
Right as you finish saying
Don't you go all silent too
Just let me chew
On all the things that you wanna tell me
I've heard whisper on a wing
Let silence sting
So, go on say what you wanna sell me
In the moments on your own
Did you beg that love would take you home?
Did you see how your love could be
And decide to hell, that's enough for me?
Did you love somebody for to make, your mistake, your fool?
Did you feel a pale wind blow past you so?
Right as you finish saying
Don't you go all silent too
Just let me chew
On all the things that you wanna tell me
I've heard whisper on a wing
Let silence sting
So, go on say what you wanna sell me

Don't you go all silent too
Just let me chew
On all the things that you wanna tell me
I've heard whisper on a wing
Let silence sting
So, go on say what you wanna sell me
Did you love somebody only just for the rush like me?
Did you fear the hand you hold had let go?
Right as you finish saying"
6,7,St. Mark's Funny Feeling,"
You said that Sabbath day's coming
I'm already through
I believe that I was staying just for you
What good is anyone honey
Without being yours
I did almost all the things I left you for

Wasted away to nothing
Flat out on the floor without you
St. Mark's got him a funny feeling

You've been coming up 
But you never looked at me
Was it bad I wanted too much for free
2 hits in a mid-day Sunday
Without being yours
I keep dropping to my knees and crying lord

Wasting away to nothing
Ground down like a stone without you
St. Mark's got him a funny feeling


St. Mark's got him a funny feeling

You keep coming up
All I ever do is flee
I go on this way for long I must be
Two pennies short of one dollar
Frayed, i'm like a rope
With your only fornication at your throat

Wasting away to nothing
On the floor, whoosh you're gone
Left alone a-singing your song
The way that
St. Mark's got him a funny feeling"
7,8,Magpie,"Sippin' up a tin can
Bit of a wasted while
Never put in too much effort, no
When his days let go
Sniffin' anything just to get him a taste
He tried it, he couldn't
Kick that old malaise
From his golden days
Feelings fade
Drippin' off a thin, thin, thin
Thin as it gets
A line of a woman
Just to keep his toes
Underneath his nose
She lets go
You're the wrong guy, Magpie
Haven't you a good point
The strip joints still having you
We ain't gonna get you outta here
No, we ain't gonna get you outta here
Which you're fond of saying
I know that you're down as ever though
Oh, I know that you're down as ever though
And you want it baby

Rippin' on a six speed
Wind in the face
He's wild and he's looking
To that open sky
For some life inside
He's so tried
You're the wrong guy, Magpie
Haven't you a good point
The strip joints still having you
We ain't gonna get you outta here
No, we ain't gonna get you outta here
Which you're fond of saying
I know that you're down as ever though
Oh, I know that you're down as ever though
And you want it baby
We ain't gonna get you outta here
No, we ain't gonna get you outta here
Which you're fond of saying
I know that you're down as ever though
Oh, I know that you're down as ever though
And you want it baby"
8,9,Nowhere Next To Me,"
Waking up on this side of it
I forget, which I'm hiding in
I'm a wreck, I've been awful cruel, huh?
Buttercup, hold me, lie to me
Tell me there's peace inside to be
Heavens sake, I've a lot that you could love

But you take a second more
And then make your way right out the door
One last look at life where I'm your baby

Now you're next to be
Nowhere next to me

On and on like you'd be around
Summer's gonе, I'm moved out now
On your arm, someone who's just likе me

Don't you wait a second more
If you've made your way right out the door
Don't go looking back 'cause no one's waiting

When you're next to be
Nowhere next to me
Yeah, you're next to be
Nowhere next to me

Waking up on this side of it
I forget, which I'm hiding in
I'm a wreck, I've been awful cruel, huh?
Buttercup, hold me, lie to me
Tell me there's peace inside to be
Heavens sake, I've a lot that you could love

Won't you take a second more?
If at last, I'm just like ones before
Won't you leave me like I'm someone, maybe?

But you're just next to be
Nowhere next to me
Yeah, you're next to be
Nowhere next to me
You're just next to be
Nowhere next to me"
9,10,Wax & Wane,"
Hoping this morning you'd be very far
But when I awake, there you are
Sitting out, in your car
I parked you right there on my mind to stay

You ain't never really wanted around here
You ain't never really wanted
Yet stay with me all the way
You ain't never really wanted around here
You ain't ever really wanted at all

Hope in the morning
You'd leave with the night
But when I awake, there's your bike
In the yard, on its side
Thrown down when you arrived
If I don't mow the grass'll grow
And swallow whole your bicycle

You ain't never really wanted around here
You ain't never really wanted
Yet stay with me all the way
You ain't never really wanted around here
You ain't ever really wanted at all

Hoping this morning
You'd leave with the blues
But when I awake, there's your shoes
On the porch, with the news
Winds blown, pages are loose
As it gets colder, you're back on my shoulder
I wish I could say that it's so over

You ain't never really wanted around here
You ain't never really wanted
Yet stay with me all the way
You ain't never really wanted around here
You ain't ever really wanted at all
You ain't never really wanted around here
You ain't never really wanted
Yet stay with me all the way
You ain't never really wanted around here
You ain't ever really wanted at all

Please just ride away
Please just ride away
Please just ride away
Please just ride away"
10,11,Your Long Black Hair,"
There lies a day, holding just for you
I'd missing living too
But it's not just down, down, down
There's always the round and round
Of peace that comes for you
Once you're through
And it's all you can do

I been thinking up a one-night train from this world
I been thinking how upon my train I'll ride from these hands
I been thinking up a railroad track
Humming off into the black
And the moment I'll despair
For your long and black hair

With every day, more than ever few
They'll slip right from you
And keep on going by, by, by
You won't even cry, cry, cry
Though each and every moon cries for you
With the weight of nights through

I been thinking up a one-night train from this world
I been thinking how upon my train I'll ride from these hands
I been thinking up a railroad track
Humming off into the black
And the moment I'll despair
For your long and black hair

Thеn as I'm done in
I'll see her a-running
Reaching out to say
Wish it away
I'm coming with
Won't you lеt me
Just as the way
I started it
You're my every
Isn't it plain to never end?
Hold me gently once I'm through
And it's all you can do

I been thinking up a one-night train from this world
I been thinking how upon my train I'll ride from these hands
I been thinking up a railroad track
Humming off into the black
And the moment I'll despair
For your long and black hair

Your long and black hair
Your long and black hair"
